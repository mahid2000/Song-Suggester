# Song-Suggester
CS1812: OOP2 Assignment 1

A Text Based Song Suggester to give you your next favourite hit ðŸ”¥ based upon your preffered genre and listening history.

Overview:

In this assignment, you will solve the problem of deciding which song should come next in the soundtrack of your life.

You will write a program that asks the user a series of Yes/No questions until a potential option is reached. If the program makes a suggestion that satisfies the user, the interaction ends. If the user is still not satisfied, the program asks for a song that they would prefer instead, plus a question that distinguishes it from the suggested option. This option and question are then added to a database. That is, the program learns new suggestions and questions and its ability to recommend good options grows.
